The following brief pseudocode implements one possible approach to delete an object from a max-heap:

\begin{codebox}
\Procname{$\proc{Max-Heap-Delete}(A,x)$}
\li $\proc{Max-Heap-Increase-Key}(A,x,\infty)$
\li $\proc{Max-Heap-Extract-Max}(A)$
\end{codebox}

In the first step, the key in the object $x$ is increased to $\infty$, which makes $x$ the object with the largest key in the heap.
The object $x$ is then extracted from the heap in the second step.

For an $n$-element max-heap $A$, each step takes $O(\lg n)$ plus the overhead for mapping priority queue objects to array indices, and so this is the running time of \proc{Max-Heap-Delete}.
