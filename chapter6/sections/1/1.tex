A binary heap can be viewed as a nearly complete binary tree, in which all levels except possibly the lowest are filled.
In such a tree of height $h$, the minimum number of nodes is $(2^h-1)+1=2^h$ (when the lowest level consists of only one node), and the maximum number of nodes is $2^{h+1}-1$ (when the binary tree is complete).
