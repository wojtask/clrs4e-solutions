By the justification in the book on page 172, the running time of \proc{Heapsort} on any $n$-element array is $O(n\lg n)$.
Combining it with the result from \refExercise{6.4-5}, we have that for any $n$-element array with distinct elements \proc{Heapsort} takes $\Theta(n\lg n)$ time.
This remains true in particular when the array is sorted in increasing order or is sorted in decreasing order.
