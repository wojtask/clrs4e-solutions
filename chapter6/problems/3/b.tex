Suppose that $Y[1,1]=\infty$ and that the Young tableau $Y$ is not empty.
Then there exist $i$, $j$ such that $1\le i\le m$ and $1\le j\le n$, and that $Y[i,j]<\infty$.
However, by the properties of Young tableaus, $\infty=Y[1,1]\le Y[1,j]\le Y[i,j]<\infty$, yielding a contradiction.
Therefore, a Young tableau $Y$, where $Y[1,1]=\infty$, must be empty.

Similarly, suppose that $Y[m,n]<\infty$ and that the Young tableau $Y$ is not full.
It means that there exist $i$, $j$ such that $1\le i\le m$ and $1\le j\le n$, and that $Y[i,j]=\infty$.
We have $\infty=Y[i,j]\le Y[i,n]\le Y[m,n]<\infty$, which is a contradiction.
Therefore, an $m\times n$ Young tableau $Y$, where $Y[m,n]<\infty$, must be full.
